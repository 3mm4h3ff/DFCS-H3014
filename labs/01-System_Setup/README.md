# Lab 1: Creating a scalable penetration testing setup 

In this lab we will start creating our penetration testing setup. I'll step through two different setups, one setup using the linux security distro Kali and a second method using the standard Ubuntu linux distro. Students may also want to check out Parrot OS as an alternative to Kali. We'll be running our attack machines as VMs on your main OS.
> You are of course free to create your own custom setup using whatever OS you prefer. 

The Kali/Parrot setup come pre-installed with hundreds of security tools so should avoid you having to install tools each week as we progress. The Ubuntu setup will involve you doing a bit more work each week as you'll need to install every tool we use every week. My personal preference after trying many different setups over the past few years is to use Ubuntu and then just install the tools I actually use and need. Keeping an up to date setup and config file allows me to just duplicate my setup where ever and when ever I need, but this can just as easily be done for Kali/Parrot also, I've just found using Ubuntu to be more stable and scalable long term.

### 1. Download and install VMware Workstation 15 Pro 
We'll be using VMware Workstation Pro (Fusion on Mac) as our main hypervisor to run our VMs. Virtualbox is the free alternative but I've found VMware Workstation to be much beter and allows much better networking and snapshot options. If you really prefer to use Virtiualbox or some other alternative for whatever reasons then there shouldn't be any issues. 
> You should have already received an email link from E-hub or similar to get your copy of VMware Workstation/Fusion Pro. If not let me know and I'll add you.  
> I'll be creating new user accounts for the next couple of weeks only, so don't wait to contact me and then expect me to sort you a licence.

### 2. Choose and install your OS (Kali or Ubuntu) 
In the labs each week I'll be doing any demos using Ubuntu 19.04, Kali VM is probably a better option for the lazy student (or those who just perfer Kali or want to learn the OS) but I won't be troubleshooting an issues people run into while using Kali or other OSs.

#### 2.1 Installing Kali Linux
- Installation guides: https://docs.kali.org/category/installation
- Kali linux downloads page: https://www.kali.org/downloads/
- Kali 2019.3 64bit VMware VM - https://images.offensive-security.com/virtual-images/kali-linux-2019.3-vmware-amd64.7z
- Kali 2019.3 64bit ISO - https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2019.3/kali-linux-2019.3-amd64.iso
        
#### 2.2 Installing Ubuntu Desktop 19.04
- Installation guide: https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop?_ga=2.250308998.1265951109.1569279578-306165233.1569279578#0
- Ubuntu Desktop 19.04: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=19.04&architecture=amd64
- Ubuntu Desktop 18.04: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=18.04.3&architecture=amd64 

#### 2.3 Add network adapters
Regardless of the OS you've chosen I'm going to recommend you add three network adapters. This setup should allow you connect your attack machine to any type of network (wireless, wired, internal) without reconfiguring much.

- Adapter 1 (Wireless Internet): Set to Bridged (goto advanced and record mac the address).
- Adapter 2 (Internal Host only): Set to 'Host-only' (goto advanced and record mac the address).
- Adapter 3 (Wired Ethernet): Set to custom vmnet2 (goto advanced and record mac the address).

> Adapter 1 could just as easily be set to NAT, but becuase of a networking restrictions in the college I'm suggesting you use bridged to avoid any issues.

#### 2.4 Virtual Network Editor
One of the most common issues I've seen students experience over the years are due to using automatic bridging and then getting connected to a different network interface to what they expected and then carelessly end up scanning the wrong network. We can use VMware's Virtual Network Editor to fine tune our network adapters and what they connect to. The instructions below assume you've created the three adapters I recommended earlier.

- Goto Edit/Virtual network editor on your VMware Workstation.
- Bottom right corner click change settings.
- VMnet0 change from bridged/automatic to bridge to your wireless card and apply changes.
- Add Network VMnet2 and set to bridged with your physical ethernet and apply changes 

> You may not see a physcial ethernet appear if you haven't an ethernet or adapter connected

### 3. Install VMWare Tools
Adding VMware tools (or guest additions on Virtualbox) gives us lots of additional options and much better usability for our VMs, paste and copying betwenn OSs, screen resolutions etc. So it's well worth installing. The latest version of Kali should detect that it is installing as a VM and automatically install some bits to make your life a bit easier.

Boot up your VM and then install VMware Tools (VM/Install VMware Tools).
> Full instructions if needed https://vitux.com/how-to-install-vmware-tools-in-ubuntu/

### 4. Update your OS and take a snapshot
It's always good practice to regularly update and upgrade your system.
> I don't suggest updating/upgrading your sysetm just before an engagement or exam. Always takle a temperary snapshot first just in case something breaks.

```bash
$ apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y 
```

Now we have a basic working setup we should take a snapshot of our VM (It's going to get messed up at some point!)
- Right click then Snapshot/Take Snapshot and name as fresh install or similar.

Since this is a clean install you might want to perform some additional tweaks and updates.. maybe even before your snapshot to customise your setup.So maybe check out some of these, and I'm sure there are plenty more.

- Strongly recommend new normal user account for kali users

### 5. Renaming our network interfaces for ease of use

    7.1 The single biggest issue faced by students is confusion about their network interfaces. 
        - We can try make it a bit easier for ourselves by adding labels to our interfaces.
    
    7.2 Adding custom interface names for Kali

    7.3 Adding custom interface names for Ubuntu

    7.4 Changing IP addresses as needed on the command line





ip -c address
sudo netplan apply
sudo gedit /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml 

# Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd 

#   Using DHCP to get an IP address from our bridged Wireless Connection
  ethernets:
    my_wifi:                          # Can set your own interface names
      dhcp4: true
      match:
        macaddress: 00:0c:29:18:7e:4f # Change Mac to match your own interface
      set-name: my_wifi               # Can set your own interface names

#   Using DHCP to get an IP address on our NATed internal host network 
    my_vms:
      dhcp4: true
      match:
        macaddress: 00:0c:29:18:7e:59 # Change Mac to match your own interface
      set-name: my_vms

#   Setting a static IP and network settings for our wired Ethernet Connection
    my_ethernet:
#     dhcp4: true
      addresses:
        - 10.10.10.2/24
      gateway4: 10.10.10.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
      match:
        macaddress: 00:0c:29:18:7e:63 # Change Mac to match your own interface
      set-name: my_ethernet

Donâ€™t forget to run update-initramfs -u afterwards to embed these updated config files into your initramfs, where they will be applied.
